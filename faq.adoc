Can an Academy action discount (e.g. take a seal at -2 cost) be applied to a Time penalty cost (e.g. +1 cost when taking a seal)?::

including any time penalty cost.

Can an Academy action discount (e.g. take a seal at -2 cost) be applied to the cost of placing the seal on my board?::

Yes. Sum the cost penalty of the scroll in the Academy (if you don't have the
objective bonus) with the placement penalty, then apply the discount over the
total.footnote:[https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3106394/article/42512545#42512545]

Can I have two tents at same location?::

No.footnote:[https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3056016/article/41999370#41999370]

Can I take a movement action (for an explorer or a ship) and move zero spaces?::

What happens to seals removed from the top Academy row during cleanup?::

What if we run out of seals when refreshing the Academy during cleanup?::
Seals are a limited resource. If you run out, you run out.

During the Rewards phase, what happens if an Envelope reward allows me to place additional stamps?::
* If placed _above_ the currently evaluated envelope, stamps will apply during the next round.
* If placed _in_ the currently evaluated envelope, stamps will apply during the next round. Do _not_ count them among the stamps to be removed for determining majority.footnote:[https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2591355/article/41343085#41343085]
* If placed _below_ the currently evaluated envelope, stamps will apply this round when that envelope is evaluated.footnote:[https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2591355/article/36880355#36880355]

## Fireland

When passing an Adventure Token during movement, do I resolve the Adventure immediately or after my main action is complete?::

Draw the Adventure card, inspect the options, and then decide when to do it
during your current turn. Consider the adventures as bonus actions you are
getting, which means you can trigger that bonus anytime during your turn like
you do when completing a character card or
objective.footnote:[https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3067378/article/42290868#42290868]

What if there are no more adventure cards, but there are still tokens on the board?::
Reshuffle the discards to form a new deck.footnote:[https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3115165/article/42610738#42610738]

Have to do adventure? Yes.

Have to accomplish crew/objective immediately or can wait? Wait.
